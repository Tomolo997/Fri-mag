#Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level
# programming language with dynamic semantics
#Algorithm is a fancy word for a detailed recipe of instructions

#1) Numbers and expression
print(1/2) # => returns 0 
print(1.0/2.0) # => returns 0.5

# Realna stevila so plavajoca, real => floats
# // double stash vedno vzame cela stevila.

# % => remainder, to kar ostane 
# 10 % 3 = 1  => ostanek je rezultat
# + => addition 
# - => substraction 
# / => division 
# * => multiplicaiton 
# ** => to the power of 

#VELIKA STEVILA 
# Navadna stevila ne smejo biti vecja od 2137483647 in manjsa od 
# - 2147483648


#Variables 
# name that represents some value 
x = 3
y = 12
print(x+y)

#Statements and expression ,
# 2*2 => statemens, they change things  , for example => (x = 12)
#print 2*2 => expression, they dont change things

input("Please enter your lucky number")

#>>> x = input("x: ")
#x: 34
#>>> y = input("y: ")
#y: 42
#>>> print x * y
#1428

# functions 
# little program that performs a specific action
# function returns a value to you, it is another type of expression


#Modules 
# Extensions that can be imported into python, to extend its
#capabilites 
#import math => than use it while calling function on it
#from math import sqrt => only imports sqrt => square root


#__future__  __future__. From it,
#we can import features that will be standard in Python in the future but that aren’t part of the
#language yet. 

#Strings
#Strings are found in almost every useful, real-world Python program and have
#many uses. Their main use is to represent bits of text, such as the exclamation “Hello, world!”
#Strings are values, just as numbers are
